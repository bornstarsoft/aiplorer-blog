In a recent speech at the High-Level Forum on Generative AI Governance and Cultural Co-Creation, Secretary for Justice Mr. Paul Lam highlighted the urgent need for legislation surrounding generative AI. As AI technology continues to evolve, the challenge lies in balancing the promotion of innovation with the necessity for accountability and credibility in its use. This is particularly crucial in a landscape where AI-generated content can easily mislead and misinform.

Mr. Lam emphasized that Hong Kong currently lacks specific laws governing AI, which raises significant concerns about copyright, misinformation, and the ethical implications of AI-generated content. With issues such as deepfakes and AI-giarism becoming increasingly prevalent, the need for a robust legal framework is more pressing than ever. The government's efforts to introduce guidelines and exceptions in copyright law are steps in the right direction, but they must be complemented by comprehensive legislation to ensure that the rights of all stakeholders are protected.

As we navigate this new frontier of technology, the question remains: how can we foster innovation while ensuring that generative AI is used responsibly? The path forward will require collaboration between governments, industry leaders, and the academic community to create a legal environment that encourages growth without compromising ethical standards.
