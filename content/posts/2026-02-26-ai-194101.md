South Korea's recently enacted AI Basic Act marks a significant step in the regulation of artificial intelligence, particularly for multinational employers. Effective from January 22, 2026, this law not only governs AI development and usage within South Korea but also extends its reach to activities outside the country that impact Korean users. This means that companies with centralized AI tools affecting Korean employees must start evaluating their compliance strategies now.

A key aspect of the AI Basic Act is its focus on "High-Impact AI," which includes AI systems that significantly influence human rights and workplace decisions. Employers utilizing AI for recruitment, performance evaluations, or any decision-making that affects employees' rights need to assess their tools against this new regulatory framework. Transparency is also crucial; the law mandates that users be informed when AI is involved in decision-making processes, emphasizing the need for clear communication to mitigate potential risks.

As the landscape of AI continues to evolve, multinational employers must stay vigilant and proactive in adapting to these regulatory changes. How will your organization prepare for the implications of the AI Basic Act?
