A recent survey by CHOSUNBIZ highlights a significant public concern regarding generative AI, with 90% of respondents fearing potential privacy breaches. This technology, capable of creating realistic images, videos, and text, has raised alarms due to its misuse in spreading misinformation and manipulating personal data. As generative AI becomes more prevalent, these concerns are only expected to escalate.

Moreover, the survey indicates that 80% of participants advocate for stricter regulations to oversee the use of generative AI. There is a clear demand for increased transparency and accountability from companies involved in developing and deploying this technology. As we navigate this evolving landscape, it is essential for policymakers and industry leaders to address these pressing issues and establish guidelines that protect individuals from potential harm.

As generative AI continues to advance, how can we ensure that innovation does not come at the cost of our privacy and security?
