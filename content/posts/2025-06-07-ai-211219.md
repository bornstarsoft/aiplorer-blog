The recent workshop on "Generative AI and Copyright" held by the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) has brought to light a pressing issue: the urgent need for accountability from AI companies that profit from the unauthorized use of creative works. As highlighted by Nina George, the Commissioner for Political Affairs at the European Writers' Council (EWC), the exploitation of authors' labor and intellectual property by non-European AI firms raises significant ethical and legal concerns. With millions of protected works being used without consent, the creative community is demanding action.

The EWC, representing 250,000 writers across 34 countries, is calling for a robust framework that ensures transparency and fair compensation for the use of their works. The message is clear: innovation should not come at the expense of creators. The workshop emphasized that the current legal frameworks, including the TDM exception, are inadequate in addressing the complexities of generative AI, which often operates in a legal gray area. 

As the JURI prepares its own-initiative report on this matter, the stakes are high for both creators and AI developers. The future of copyright in the age of AI hinges on the decisions made by policymakers in the coming months. Will they prioritize the rights of authors and artists, or will the trend of exploitation continue unchecked? The outcome will shape the landscape of digital creativity for years to come.
