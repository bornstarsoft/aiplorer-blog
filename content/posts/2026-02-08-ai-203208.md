If youre a fan of puzzle games but often find them too challenging, then Botany Manor might just be the perfect fit for you. Currently available for free on the Epic Games Store, this cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene as she explores a Victorian manor to complete her botanical research. Unlike more punishing titles like The Witness or Blue Prince, Botany Manor strikes a balance between engaging puzzles and a relaxing atmosphere, making it accessible for casual gamers.

The developers have intentionally designed the game to avoid overwhelming players with overly complex challenges. Lead developer Laure De May emphasized that the focus is on exploration and discovery rather than sheer intellectual prowess. This thoughtful approach has resonated well with players, as reflected in the positive reviews on Steam, where many highlight its suitability for cozy gaming sessions.

With Botany Manor being free for a limited time, its an excellent opportunity for both seasoned puzzle enthusiasts and newcomers to dive into a charming world of botanical mysteries. Will you take the plunge and explore the serene puzzles that await?
