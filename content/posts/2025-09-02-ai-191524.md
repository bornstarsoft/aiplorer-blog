In a groundbreaking collaboration, Siemens and Snowflake are revolutionizing how manufacturers harness their data by bridging the gap between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT). This partnership enables manufacturers to connect shop floor data with critical IT insights, leading to unprecedented operational efficiency and AI-driven insights.

By integrating Siemens Industrial Edge with Snowflakes AI Data Cloud, manufacturers can seamlessly contextualize and transfer OT data into IT systems. This synergy not only enhances machine performance and availability but also optimizes production processes across facilities, setting the stage for a new era of industrial innovation.

As Rainer Brehm, CEO of Factory Automation at Siemens, aptly puts it, this collaboration brings together the best of both worlds. With the ability to apply AI across both IT and OT data, manufacturers are poised to unlock a realm of possibilities for quality improvement and performance optimization. How will your organization leverage this convergence to drive its digital transformation?
