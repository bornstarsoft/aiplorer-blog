In a significant turn of events, Frontier Developments has decided to remove generative AI portraits from the upcoming Jurassic World Evolution 3, following a wave of backlash from fans. Initially revealed during the Summer Game Fest 2025, the game generated excitement among the community, only to face criticism when it was discovered that AI technology was used to create some in-game scientist portraits. This decision sparked a campaign among fans advocating for content crafted by human artists instead.

The response from the developers has been swift and reassuring. In a recent post on Steam, they confirmed the removal of AI-generated portraits, stating, "Thanks for your feedback on this topic. We have opted to remove the use of generative AI for scientist portraits within Jurassic World Evolution 3." This change has been met with enthusiasm from the community, who are eager to see authentic artwork in the game.

With a release date set for October 21, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, fans can look forward to a game that reflects their preferences. As the gaming industry continues to navigate the complexities of AI integration, this decision by Frontier serves as a reminder of the importance of community feedback in shaping the future of gaming.

Will this shift influence how other developers approach AI in their games? Only time will tell.
