In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, becoming AI literate is not just beneficial; it's essential. Dr. Gearóid Ó Súilleabháin, an expert in technology-enhanced learning, emphasizes that education must go beyond basic AI skills. Students need a comprehensive understanding of AI's workings, its ethical implications, and its potential to reshape the future of work.

Dr. Ó Súilleabháin highlights the mixed feelings among educators and students regarding AI. While some view it as a tool for innovation, others fear its impact on job security and the educational process. The key lies in preparing students for a world where AI is integrated into everyday tasks, allowing them to leverage this technology to enhance their learning experiences.

As we look ahead, the challenge will be to strike a balance between utilizing AI as a supportive tool and ensuring that human judgment remains at the forefront of education. How can we best prepare the next generation to thrive in a world where humans and machines collaborate seamlessly?
