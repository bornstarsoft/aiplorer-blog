Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa recently addressed concerns regarding the rising costs of memory components and their potential impact on the pricing of the upcoming Switch 2. Despite the escalating prices of RAM, largely driven by demand from AI data centers, Furukawa reassured fans that there are currently no plans to increase the console's price. This decision reflects Nintendo's commitment to maintaining affordability for its consumers while navigating supply chain challenges.

During a recent financial call, Furukawa emphasized that Nintendo is actively engaging with suppliers to secure a stable supply of components. He acknowledged that while the surge in memory prices has not yet affected hardware profitability, the company remains vigilant. Should these costs continue to rise, Nintendo will reassess its pricing strategy, taking into account various factors such as market conditions and sales trends.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo balances profitability with consumer accessibility. Will they manage to keep the Switch 2 competitively priced, or will external pressures force a reevaluation? Only time will tell.
