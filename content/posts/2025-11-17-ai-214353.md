The European Commission's approach to AI policy is increasingly influenced by speculative claims from tech CEOs, raising concerns among scientists and scholars. A recent letter signed by over 200 experts urges President Ursula von der Leyen to retract unscientific assertions about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence, which have found their way into EU policy frameworks.

This trend of policymaking driven by speculation rather than rigorous science poses significant risks. The EU's commitment to an "AI first" strategy, which prioritizes AI solutions without critical evaluation, could lead to costly consequences for taxpayers and the environment. As data centers proliferate, their environmental impact becomes more pronounced, particularly in countries like Ireland, where energy consumption is already a pressing issue.

Policymakers must prioritize evidence-based approaches over the hype generated by tech giants. The future of AI in Europe should be shaped by scientific rigor and public interest, not the financial imperatives of a few influential CEOs. How can we ensure that our digital policies serve the public good rather than corporate interests?
