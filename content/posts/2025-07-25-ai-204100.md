In a recent discussion, Googles Gary Illyes made a significant statement: you dont need specialized optimization strategies like AEO or GEO to rank in AI search. Instead, standard SEO practices are sufficient for both AI Overviews and AI Mode. This revelation is crucial for marketers and content creators navigating the evolving landscape of search engine optimization.

Illyes emphasized that AI is deeply integrated into every stage of the search processfrom crawling and indexing to ranking. The core message is clear: the foundation of creating high-quality, helpful content remains paramount, regardless of whether its produced by a human or AI. This shift highlights the importance of content quality over the method of creation, urging SEOs to focus on delivering value to users.

As we move forward, its essential to adapt our strategies to align with these insights. Are you ready to embrace the future of SEO in an AI-driven world?
