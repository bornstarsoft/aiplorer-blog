The rise of artificial intelligence is sending shockwaves through the classifieds industry, with fears that it could fundamentally alter the business models of major players. Recent reports indicate that billions have been wiped off the market value of leading classifieds companies, as investors grow increasingly wary of AI's potential to streamline processes that traditionally relied on dedicated platforms. With tools like OpenAIs ChatGPT and Googles Gemini capable of connecting users to homes, jobs, and cars without the need for intermediary websites, the landscape is shifting dramatically.

As the industry grapples with these changes, speculation is mounting around companies like Rightmove potentially becoming acquisition targets. The implications of AI on online classifieds are profound, raising questions about the future viability of these platforms. Will they adapt to the new reality, or will they fade into obsolescence? The next few years will be crucial in determining how these giants respond to the AI threat, and it will be fascinating to watch their strategies unfold.
