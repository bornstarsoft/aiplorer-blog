As generative AI continues to permeate various sectors, the pressing question remains: will AI replace us? This was the focal point of a recent panel hosted by the UConn Humanities Institute, where experts from law, technology, and public policy gathered to explore the implications of AI on employment and societal structures. The discussion highlighted the dual nature of AI as both a potential job disruptor and a catalyst for new opportunities.

Legal expert Sachin S. Pandya emphasized the importance of proactive legislation, citing examples from states like New York and Montana that are navigating the complexities of AI in the workplace. Meanwhile, state Senator James Maroney raised concerns about equity in employment, particularly how AI tools could disproportionately affect marginalized groups. On the other hand, UConn's Chief Information Officer, Ted Laskaris, encouraged a more optimistic view, suggesting that AI should be seen as a tool that enhances human capabilities rather than a replacement.

The panel concluded with a call for active engagement from all stakeholders to shape a future where AI aligns with our values. As we stand on the brink of this technological revolution, how can we ensure that AI serves as a partner in our work rather than a competitor?
