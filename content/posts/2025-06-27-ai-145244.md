The rise of agentic AI is not just a trend; it's a transformative force reshaping enterprise workflows across various industries. As companies increasingly adopt these intelligent agents, the emphasis on trust becomes paramount to unlocking their full potential. This shift is particularly evident in sectors like financial services, where generative AI is streamlining document summarization and enhancing data retrieval, ultimately accelerating decision-making processes.

Experts like Jayeeta Putatunda from Fitch Group and Paul Sciaudone from HP highlight the critical need for honest assessments as organizations invest in AI initiatives. The conversation around agentic AI is not just about efficiency; it also raises important questions about governance and trust. As these technologies evolve, the integration of human oversight remains essential to ensure responsible implementation, especially in industries with stringent regulatory requirements.

Looking ahead, the future of agentic AI will likely hinge on greater standardization and interoperability. Google's recent Agent2Agent Protocol is a significant step in this direction, facilitating smoother integration of agentic capabilities across platforms. As we navigate this new landscape, how can organizations balance innovation with the necessary safeguards to build trust in AI?
