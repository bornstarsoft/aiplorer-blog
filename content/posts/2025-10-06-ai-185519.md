The City of London Corporation has taken a significant step towards responsible technology use by introducing a comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generative AI. This framework not only sets clear expectations for employees and stakeholders but also emphasizes the importance of ethical governance in an era where AI tools are becoming integral to workplace practices.

Key aspects of the SOP include rigorous governance and oversight, ensuring that all uses of Generative AI are declared and assessed for compliance with legal standards. The policy mandates transparency in AI-generated content, requiring users to take responsibility for its accuracy and ethical implications. With a focus on data protection and risk management, the City Corporation aims to foster innovation while safeguarding public trust.

As we navigate the evolving landscape of AI technology, the City of London Corporation's initiative serves as a model for other organizations. How will your organization ensure ethical AI use in its operations?
