In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Zhixiang Future has emerged as a formidable player, achieving over 100 million yuan in revenue in 2025. Their innovative approach to visual multimodality, particularly through their product vivago.ai, has not only captured the attention of users worldwide but also positioned them as a leader in the market. With nearly 10 million new users in January 2026 alone, it's clear that the commercial potential for Zhixiang Future is immense.

The company has made significant strides since its inception, launching groundbreaking models like HiDream - I1 and HiDream - E1, both of which have gained international acclaim. Their commitment to open-source technology has further solidified their reputation, as evidenced by HiDream - I1 topping the prestigious Artificial Analysis evaluation list shortly after its release. As they prepare for another round of substantial financing, the future looks bright for this innovative firm.

As competition in the AI-powered visual generation space intensifies, Zhixiang Future's strong technical foundation and clear business strategy will be crucial in navigating the challenges ahead. What new heights will they reach as they continue to push the boundaries of multimodal applications?
