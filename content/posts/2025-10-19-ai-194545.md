As the AI gold rush accelerates, fears of a dotcom-style bubble loom large. With major players like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon driving growth, the S&P 500 has become increasingly reliant on a handful of tech giants. The question remains: are we witnessing irrational exuberance, or is there genuine value in these investments?

The current price-to-earnings ratios suggest caution. While Nvidia's ratio has settled to a more reasonable 52 after soaring to 147, the overall market sentiment is still jittery. With capital spending on AI infrastructure skyrocketing, the expectation for rapid revenue growth is paramount. If AI doesnt start generating substantial returns soon, we might be on the brink of a significant market correction.

However, the speed of AI adoption is unprecedented. Recent studies show that generative AI usage has doubled in just one year, indicating a robust market potential. As we look ahead, the real question is whether this momentum can translate into sustainable profits, or if we are simply riding another speculative wave.
