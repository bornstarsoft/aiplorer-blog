In an inspiring move towards inclusivity, Tencent Holdings is actively seeking partnerships with other major AI developers to enhance the interaction of generative AI services with vulnerable populations. This initiative is particularly focused on improving the experiences of the elderly, left-behind children, and other marginalized groups who increasingly rely on AI for emotional support and health assistance. According to Lu Shiyu, a senior researcher at Tencent Research Institute, specialized data sets can significantly enhance AI services, making them more relevant and helpful to these users.

Since 2024, Lu's team has been dedicated to creating specialized data sets tailored for vulnerable users. Their research has highlighted the need for AI models to better address sensitive topics such as sex education, especially for Chinas 69 million left-behind children. Collaborating with non-profit organizations, they have developed an elderly data set based on real interactions with elderly respondents, showcasing the potential for AI to provide meaningful support.

Looking ahead, Lu emphasizes the importance of collaboration with major AI model developers to maximize the impact of these advancements. As AI continues to evolve, how can we ensure that these technologies serve the needs of the most vulnerable in our society?
