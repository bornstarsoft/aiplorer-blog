How hard is it to beat the market? Despite the rise of artificial intelligence in investment strategies, the reality is that even AI struggles to outperform traditional benchmarks. A significant number of investment firms have adopted AI technologies, yet the arithmetic of active management suggests that the average manager will still lag behind the market. This paradox highlights the limitations of AI in generating consistent alpha in a competitive landscape.

The data is telling. For instance, the Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, which tracks hedge funds utilizing AI, has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. Moreover, the percentage of actively managed U.S. large-cap mutual funds beating the market has not improved, despite the increasing integration of AI tools. This raises an important question: if AI cannot guarantee superior performance, what does the future hold for investors?

As we look ahead, its crucial to keep our expectations in check. While AI can enhance research and analysis, the notion that it will revolutionize investment success remains uncertain. Will we ultimately find ourselves investing in low-cost index funds as AI's recommendations converge on simplicity? Only time will tell.
