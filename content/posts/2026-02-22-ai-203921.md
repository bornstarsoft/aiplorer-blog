Generative AI is making waves in Vit Nam, with an impressive 89.3% of students and 81.9% of educators embracing these tools. However, a recent study reveals a concerning gap in foundational AI understanding, indicating that while adoption is soaring, readiness is lagging behind. Nearly two-thirds of educators have completed AI-related courses, yet only about a quarter of students have received formal training, highlighting a critical need for enhanced AI literacy across the education sector.

The findings from the AI Ready ASEAN Research emphasize the urgency of addressing these gaps. As Southeast Asia's digital economy is projected to skyrocket from $300 billion to $1 trillion by 2030, the ability to adopt AI responsibly will be crucial for shaping future skills and ensuring social inclusion. With rapid digitalization reshaping economies and public services, its vital that educational institutions and policymakers prioritize AI literacy to empower both educators and students alike.

As we look to the future, the question remains: How can we bridge the gap between AI adoption and literacy to ensure that technological advancements benefit everyone, not just a select few?
