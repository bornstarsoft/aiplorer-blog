In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, Zhixiang Future has emerged as a formidable player in the multi-modal AI space, achieving over 100 million yuan in revenue by 2025. Their flagship product, vivago.ai, has not only gained immense popularity, with nearly 10 million new users in January 2026, but also secured a spot in the top 10 of the Google Play Store's "Video Playing and Editing" category across more than 100 countries. This remarkable growth underscores the vast commercial potential that lies within the realm of visual multimodality.

Since its inception, Zhixiang Future has made significant strides with the release of its image generation model HiDream-I1 and the interaction and editing model HiDream-E1, both of which were made open-source in April 2025. Their innovative approach, combining a super-model with over 10 billion parameters and a unique diffusion self-regression architecture, has positioned them at the forefront of AI-driven creativity in industries ranging from film to advertising.

As the company gears up for its Series B financing, insiders hint at substantial investments that could propel Zhixiang Future into a new phase of growth. With strong backing from top investors and a clear vision for the future, the question remains: what new heights will this innovative company reach in the ever-competitive field of AI?
