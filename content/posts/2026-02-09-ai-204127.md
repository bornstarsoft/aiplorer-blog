AI is not just transforming industries; it is reshaping the very fabric of our workforce. A recent report from the International Labour Organization (ILO) highlights a pressing concern: women in the Philippines are facing double the exposure to generative AI compared to their male counterparts. This disparity, particularly among young and educated women in clerical and administrative roles, raises critical questions about the inclusivity of our technological advancements and the future of work.

The ILO's findings underscore the urgent need for targeted investments in AI and digital skills for women and youth. As we stand on the brink of a new era defined by AI, we must ensure that these groups are not merely adapting to changes but are actively involved in shaping the technologies that will define their futures. By embedding STEM pathways early in education and supporting women-led enterprises, we can turn potential inequalities into opportunities for innovation and growth.

As we approach the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, we are reminded that the future of work is not predetermined. It is a choice we make today. Will we design an inclusive future that empowers everyone, or will we allow existing inequalities to persist? The time to act is now.
