The advent of generative AI is reshaping the marketing landscape, but the real threat lies not in poor-quality content but in the normalization of the 'just good enough' economy. As brands like Disney partner with AI companies to produce average creative work at scale, marketers must grapple with the implications of this shift. The focus is no longer on crafting exceptional narratives but on generating content that merely captures attention, leading to a dilution of brand value and audience expectations.

This transition is concerning because it risks eroding the premium layer of creativity that has historically differentiated brands. As generative systems allow characters and mascots to exist in a more ambient, context-free environment, the unique power of brand assets diminishes. Marketers must now consider which content deserves genuine investment in human judgment versus what can be treated as disposable.

As we move forward, the challenge will be to maintain the integrity of brand storytelling in a world increasingly dominated by competent yet interchangeable content. Will brands find a way to balance efficiency with creativity, or will they succumb to the pressures of producing 'just good enough' content?
