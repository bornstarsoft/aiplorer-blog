The upcoming 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale Conference promises to be a pivotal event, focusing on the intersection of generative AI and the future of learning and making in architecture. This two-day conference, scheduled for November 14-15, 2025, will gather a diverse group of expertsincluding architects, neuroscientists, and media artiststo explore how AI is reshaping our understanding of creativity and intelligence. The key insight here is that generative AI does not simply imitate; it draws from a rich tapestry of historical precedents, challenging us to rethink the very foundations of design and learning.

As we delve into the implications of AI-driven creativity, the conference will address critical topics such as the politics of data and the emergence of new forms of intelligence. With panels featuring distinguished speakers from leading institutions, this event aims to foster a dialogue that transcends traditional boundaries, encouraging innovative approaches to design and education. How will these discussions influence the future of architecture and our broader understanding of intelligence in the age of AI?
