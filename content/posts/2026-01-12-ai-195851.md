In a recent AMA session, Larian Studios clarified its stance on the use of generative AI in game development, emphasizing that while they will not utilize AI for art or writing in their upcoming Divinity title, they will leverage it to enhance their development processes. CEO Swen Vincke stated that this approach aims to streamline idea refinement, ultimately leading to a more focused development cycle and higher-quality games.

The decision to exclude generative AI from artistic and narrative elements reflects a commitment to authenticity and ownership in game creation. By ensuring that all art and writing are crafted without AI assistance, Larian aims to eliminate any ambiguity regarding the origins of their content. However, the door remains open for future projects, as Vincke hinted that AI-generated assets could be considered, provided they are developed using proprietary models.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, Larian's careful navigation of generative AI raises important questions about the balance between innovation and artistic integrity. Will other developers follow suit, or will the debate over AI's role in creative fields intensify?
