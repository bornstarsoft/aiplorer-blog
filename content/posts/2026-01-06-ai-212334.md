The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming the music industry, making it possible for anyone to create high-quality music without extensive training or traditional instruments. As demonstrated by Priscilla Angelique-Page's journey from a dance artist to creating an all-male post-punk band using AI tools, the barriers to music production are rapidly dissolving. This shift not only democratizes music creation but also raises questions about the future of artistry and authenticity in the industry.

With platforms like Suno and Mubert enabling users to generate music from simple text prompts, the landscape of music composition is changing dramatically. Musicians and non-musicians alike can now produce studio-quality tracks in mere minutes, leading to an explosion of creativity and innovation. As we embrace these tools, the challenge remains: how do we maintain the essence of musical artistry in an age where anyone can be a creator?

As we look to the future, it will be fascinating to see how artists adapt to these new technologies and what new genres and styles will emerge from this creative revolution. Will AI become a collaborator or a competitor in the world of music? Only time will tell.
