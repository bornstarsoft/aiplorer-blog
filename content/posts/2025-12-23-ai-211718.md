The push for sovereign Generative AI solutions is gaining momentum, yet it may inadvertently deepen the dependency of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) on complex technological infrastructures. As nations like Canada and India invest billions into domestically controlled AI systems, the allure of technological independence and cultural preservation is overshadowed by the risk of digital nationalism that could further marginalize these countries in the global tech landscape.

While the rhetoric surrounding sovereign AI is enticing, it often masks the reality that many LMICs lack the foundational resources and expertise to develop and maintain these systems effectively. Instead of fostering true empowerment, this trend may lead to a cycle of dependency on local versions of the very technologies they seek to escape from.

As we navigate this complex landscape, it's crucial to reflect on how we can support equitable access to AI technologies without falling into the trap of digital nationalism. Are we truly empowering nations, or are we merely reshaping the dynamics of dependency in a new guise?
