In the rapidly evolving landscape of direct-to-consumer brands, Boll & Branch stands out for its innovative approach to integrating AI into both operational and creative tasks. Chief Commercial Officer Katia Unlu shared insights on how the company leverages generative AI tools to enhance internal productivity while maintaining a human touch in customer-facing content. The brand's philosophy is clear: use AI to remove friction, not to replace the human element.

Boll & Branch employs AI to streamline workflows, particularly through tools like Google Suite and Notebook LM, which help the marketing team generate weekly reports efficiently. This approach allows the team to focus on creativity rather than administrative tasks. Additionally, the brand is cautious in its use of AI-generated imagery, opting for it only in contexts where the surreal nature is evident, thus preserving authenticity in their marketing materials.

As they explore new avenues for AI integration, including using ChatGPT for influencer sourcing and media planning, Boll & Branch is committed to continuously testing and learning. This proactive stance not only enhances their marketing strategies but also aligns with evolving consumer expectations. How will other brands adapt their AI strategies in the face of changing consumer perceptions?
