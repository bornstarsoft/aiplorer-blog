The recent Deloitte report highlights a remarkable trend: 58% of consumers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia are now using generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. This adoption rate significantly surpasses that of European markets, showcasing the region's rapid digital transformation and tech-savvy populace. As consumers increasingly engage with AI, mobile technology, and social commerce, businesses must adapt their strategies to meet evolving expectations.

Moreover, the study reveals that 73% of consumers in these markets have made purchases through social media in the past year, indicating a shift towards influencer-driven shopping experiences. While the enthusiasm for generative AI is evident, concerns about data privacy remain a significant barrier for many users.
