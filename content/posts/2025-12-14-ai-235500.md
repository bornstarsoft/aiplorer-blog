As local journalism faces unprecedented challenges from declining revenues and the rise of news deserts, AI emerges as a double-edged sword. While it poses risks by potentially diminishing the role of human journalists, it also offers transformative opportunities to enhance the efficiency and reach of local news outlets. By automating mundane tasks and synthesizing information from public institutions, AI can help local journalists focus on what they do best: building community connections and holding power accountable.

The integration of AI into local newsrooms is already underway, with some organizations leveraging it to produce thousands of articles weekly. For instance, News Corp Australia has harnessed generative AI to streamline content creation, allowing journalists to dedicate more time to in-depth reporting. This shift not only addresses the resource constraints many local outlets face but also highlights the potential for AI to support public-interest journalism in ways that were previously unimaginable.

As we look to the future, the key question remains: how can local news organizations balance the benefits of AI with the need for human oversight and ethical reporting? The path forward may well depend on our ability to navigate this complex landscape thoughtfully and collaboratively.
