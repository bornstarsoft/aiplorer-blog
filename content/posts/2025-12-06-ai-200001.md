Generative AI is reshaping the landscape for writers, artists, and designers, creating both opportunities and challenges. As technology advances, many in the creative community are experiencing a decline in commission jobs and an increase in content theft, raising concerns about the future of creative professions. This shift not only affects income but also raises questions about originality and ownership in a digital age dominated by AI-generated content.

For creatives like Samantha Mary Beiko, the traditional tools of the trade, such as typewriters, symbolize a connection to the past and a resistance to the encroaching wave of automation. As generative AI continues to evolve, its crucial for artists to find ways to adapt and innovate while maintaining their unique voices. How will the creative community balance the benefits of AI with the preservation of their craft in the years to come?
