Frontier Developments has made a significant decision to remove generative AI portraits from Jurassic World Evolution 3, following a wave of backlash from the gaming community. The excitement surrounding the gameâ€™s reveal was quickly overshadowed when fans discovered that AI technology was used to create certain in-game scientist portraits, prompting a strong reaction against the use of AI in creative roles.

In response to the outcry, Frontier confirmed via a Steam post that they would be reverting to human-created art for the portraits, a move that has been met with widespread approval from fans. This decision highlights the ongoing debate about the role of AI in creative industries and the importance of human touch in artistic endeavors. As one Steam user aptly noted, the initial decision to use AI was seen as unnecessary and counterproductive.

With the game still set to launch on October 21, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, fans are now looking forward to a more traditional artistic approach. This situation raises questions about how other game developers will navigate the balance between innovation and community expectations in the future. Will we see more companies reconsidering their use of AI in creative processes?
