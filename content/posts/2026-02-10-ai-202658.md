In 2025, a staggering 64% of young people aged 16-24 in the EU embraced generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, nearly double the usage rate of the general population. This trend highlights how the younger generation is not just passive consumers of technology but active participants, integrating AI into various aspects of their lives, from education to personal projects.

The data reveals that young people are particularly inclined to use AI for educational purposes, with 39.3% utilizing these tools for formal learning, compared to just 9.4% among older demographics. This shift suggests a transformative change in how education is approached, potentially leading to more personalized and engaging learning experiences. Countries like Greece and Estonia lead the way, showcasing the diverse adoption rates across Europe.

As we celebrate Safer Internet Day, it's crucial to reflect on the implications of this growing trend. How will the integration of AI in education and personal life shape the future of work and learning for these young innovators? The conversation is just beginning.
