New research from Microsoft reveals that marketing and sales professionals are among the most affected by generative AI, with an analysis of 200,000 workplace conversations highlighting that writing, research, and communication tasks are where AI excels. Sales representatives, in particular, received a high AI applicability score, indicating that AI is reshaping these roles significantly.

While AI proves effective in tasks like gathering information and writing content, it struggles with areas requiring creativity or in-person interaction, such as visual design and event marketing. This suggests that while AI can enhance productivity, it is not a complete replacement for human creativity and strategic thinking.

As we move forward, the integration of AI in marketing and sales will likely continue to evolve. How will you adapt your skills to stay relevant in this changing landscape?
