Generative AI is reshaping how we connect with our past, as evidenced by a remarkable project in New Brighton that has successfully restored and animated historic photographs. This initiative not only breathes life into static images from the Victorian era to the late twentieth century but also fosters a renewed sense of community pride and engagement with local heritage.

The project showcases the potential of AI to transform archival research into dynamic visual narratives, making history more accessible and relatable to digital audiences. The immediate public responsetens of thousands of views and extensive social media interactionhighlights a deep-rooted interest in local identity and shared memories among residents.

As New Brighton continues to embrace creative revitalization through public art and community projects, one can't help but wonder: how will technology further bridge the gap between our past and future? Will we see more initiatives that harness the power of AI to deepen our connection to history?
