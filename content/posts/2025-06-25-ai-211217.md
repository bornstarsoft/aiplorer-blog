In a surprising turn of events, Frontier Developments has decided to remove generative AI portraits from the highly anticipated *Jurassic World Evolution 3* following significant backlash from its fanbase. The decision comes after fans expressed their dissatisfaction with the use of AI-generated content, advocating for art created by human artists instead. This response highlights the growing concern within the gaming community regarding the role of AI in creative processes.

The announcement was made shortly after the game's reveal trailer during the Summer Game Fest 2025, where excitement quickly turned to disappointment upon learning about the AI technology used for scientist portraits. In a move that reflects the power of community feedback, Frontier confirmed that they would revert to traditional art methods for these portraits, much to the delight of fans eager for a more authentic gaming experience.

As *Jurassic World Evolution 3* prepares for its release on October 21, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, this incident serves as a reminder of the importance of listening to player feedback. Will this decision set a precedent for other game developers to prioritize human creativity over AI in their projects? Only time will tell.
