Legendary investor Ray Dalio has raised a crucial point about the impending impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and humanoid robots on wealth distribution. He warns that these technologies may disproportionately benefit the top 1% to 10% of the population, leading to increased wealth inequality and societal challenges. Dalio suggests that a new redistribution policy will be necessary to address these disparities as AI continues to evolve and potentially render many jobs obsolete.

During a recent podcast appearance, Dalio emphasized the potential for advanced AI systems and humanoid robots to replace skilled professionals, questioning the future need for roles such as lawyers and doctors. He highlighted the importance of not only redistributing wealth but also finding ways to engage those who may become useless in a world dominated by autonomous agents. This perspective raises significant questions about how society will adapt to these technological changes and what measures can be taken to ensure a more equitable future.

As we stand on the brink of a technological revolution, Dalio's insights compel us to consider: Will we be able to create a system that prioritizes the collective good over individual greed? The answers to these questions will shape the future of work and society as a whole.
