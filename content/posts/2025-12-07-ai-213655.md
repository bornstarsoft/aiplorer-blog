As generative AI continues to reshape our information systems, a pivotal question arises: will it expand opportunities for entrepreneurs or merely reinforce the dominance of existing incumbents? This dilemma is not just about technology; its about how we choose to harness its potential. Entrepreneurs, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, have a unique chance to leverage AI tools that were once out of reach, but without careful policy intervention, the benefits may skew heavily towards established players.

The historical trajectory of the internet serves as a cautionary tale. Initially, it appeared to democratize access and empower small businesses, yet over time, consolidation led to a few giants controlling the landscape. Today, as AI accelerates this trend, we must ask ourselves: how can we ensure that the future of AI fosters innovation and supports new creators rather than entrenching the status quo? The answer lies in intentional policy-making and a commitment to building inclusive ecosystems that prioritize the needs of all entrepreneurs.

As we look ahead, the challenge remains: can we bend AI technology toward fostering a vibrant entrepreneurial landscape? Or will we watch as it becomes another tool that benefits the few at the expense of the many?
