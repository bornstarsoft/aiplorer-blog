KT is breaking new ground in the film industry with its upcoming release of Code:G The Beginning of Attention, a generative AI film set to hit CGV theaters on December 27. This marks a significant milestone as it is the first major commercial release of a film produced with generative AI technology, showcasing the potential of AI to transform content creation and storytelling.

The film features five short stories, with four produced entirely without live-action actors, relying solely on AI-generated imagery. This innovative approach not only challenges traditional filmmaking norms but also raises questions about the future of creativity in cinema. Notably, the hybrid short Memory Administration combines human performance with AI visuals, illustrating the evolving relationship between technology and artistry.

As KT ventures into this uncharted territory, the company aims to assess audience reactions and market viability, potentially paving the way for more AI-driven projects in the future. Will this experiment redefine the filmmaking landscape, or will it remain a niche curiosity? Only time will tell.
