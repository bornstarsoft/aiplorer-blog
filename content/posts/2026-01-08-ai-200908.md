The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is making significant strides in expanding the adoption of generative AI, driven by early successes in pilot programs. As they navigate the complexities of a vast data ecosystem, leaders like Marcie Kahbody, Caltrans CIO, emphasize the importance of a structured approach to harnessing this technology effectively. By establishing a dedicated executive position for data and AI, Caltrans aims to create cohesive governance and policy frameworks that can support their ambitious goals.

With the rollout of tools like Microsoft Copilot to thousands of employees, Caltrans is already witnessing tangible benefits, such as time savings and increased efficiency. The development of a new GIS data hub and an internal chatbot further illustrates their commitment to leveraging technology for improved operations. As they continue to engage with industry partners, the question remains: how can other organizations learn from Caltrans journey to integrate generative AI into their own systems?
