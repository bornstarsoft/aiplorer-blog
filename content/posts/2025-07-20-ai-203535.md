Netflix has taken a significant leap into the future of filmmaking by confirming its use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the production of its original series, The Eternaut. This groundbreaking decision marks the first time the streaming giant has utilized AI to create final on-screen visual effects, showcasing a potential shift in how films and series are produced. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos highlighted that the use of AI allowed for the creation of a complex scene involving a building collapse in Buenos Aires, which would have been prohibitively expensive with traditional VFX methods.

The results speak for themselves: the AI-generated VFX sequence was completed ten times faster than conventional workflows, demonstrating not only cost-effectiveness but also the speed at which creative visions can be realized. Sarandos emphasized that this technology represents a remarkable opportunity for creators, suggesting that AI can enhance the filmmaking process by making it more efficient without sacrificing quality. As the industry continues to evolve, one can't help but wonder: will generative AI redefine the standards of visual storytelling in cinema?
