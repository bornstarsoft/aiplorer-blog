This week, gamers have an exciting opportunity to grab two unique titles for free on the Epic Games Store: Strange Horticulture and Kamaeru. Available until August 28, these games offer a blend of puzzle-solving and adventure that can captivate both casual and hardcore gamers alike. Strange Horticulture, an occult puzzle game, immerses players in the role of a plant shop owner tasked with solving mysterious puzzles through plant identification and customer interaction.

In addition to the Epic Games Store offerings, Amazon Prime Gaming is also providing two titles: Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective and Silver Box Classics. To access these games, users need an active Amazon Prime subscription, which is a great value for those who enjoy gaming and streaming content. With such a diverse range of games available for free, its a perfect time for gamers to expand their libraries without spending a dime.

As we see more platforms offering free games, it raises the question: how will this trend shape the future of gaming and game distribution? Are we entering a new era where accessibility and variety take precedence over traditional sales models?
