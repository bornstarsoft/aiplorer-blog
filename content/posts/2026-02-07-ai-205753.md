In a significant move to enhance its global presence, JetSynthesys has acquired the popular merge puzzle game EverMerge, which has amassed over $350 million in lifetime revenue. This acquisition not only highlights JetSynthesys' ambition to build a worldwide gaming ecosystem but also underscores the game's robust performance in key markets like the US and Western Europe. With EverMerge ranked among the top 100 highest-grossing mobile games of all time, the potential for growth in emerging markets, particularly India, is immense.

Rajan Navani, Chairman & MD of JetSynthesys, emphasized the importance of this acquisition in bridging global intellectual properties with local insights. The company aims to leverage its expertise in community engagement to resonate with new audiences through culturally relevant storytelling and innovative technology. As JetSynthesys continues to invest in EverMerge, the future looks promising for both the game and its expanding player community.

As the gaming landscape evolves, will JetSynthesys successfully tap into the potential of emerging markets and redefine the gaming experience for players worldwide?
