The recent AI Journey International Conference in Moscow highlighted a pivotal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence and machine learning. With the participation of President Vladimir Putin, the event celebrated its tenth anniversary, showcasing groundbreaking innovations from Russian companies, including Sberbank's anthropomorphic robot and Yandex's generative AI models. This conference not only marks a decade of progress but also emphasizes the strategic importance of developing national AI technologies to ensure technological sovereignty.

During his address, President Putin underscored the necessity of fostering a robust ecosystem for AI development, which includes creating national language models and enhancing the infrastructure for AI applications across various sectors. The call for a national plan to implement generative AI reflects a growing recognition of its potential to contribute significantly to the economy, with a target of over 11 trillion rubles by 2030. As the global race for AI supremacy intensifies, Russia's commitment to developing its own technologies could reshape the future landscape of AI.

As we look ahead, the question remains: how will nations balance technological advancement with ethical considerations and global collaboration in the AI space? The journey is just beginning, and the implications of these developments will resonate far beyond the conference walls.
